Project Description:
The Fake News Detection System aims to develop a software solution that can identify and flag potentially false or misleading news articles and reports across various digital platforms and news sources.

Objectives
Develop a reliable and efficient fake news detection algorithm.
Implement a user-friendly web interface for users to submit news articles for verification.
Establish a database of known reliable and unreliable news sources.
Enable real-time monitoring of news articles for potential fake news.
Generate reports and alerts for identified fake news content.
Enhance the system's accuracy through continuous machine learning and user feedback.
